Welcome to the \href{https://github.com/crossbario/autobahn-cpp}{\tt Autobahn-\/\+C++} documentation.~\newline
~\newline
 Autobahn-\/\+C++ is a client library for the \href{http://wamp-proto.org/}{\tt W\+A\+MP protocol} that allows developers to create W\+A\+MP application components in C++.

Application components connect to a W\+A\+MP router like \href{http://crossbar.io}{\tt Crossbar.\+io} which acts as a messaging layer that allows seamless, secure and cross-\/language communication with other components.

With Autobahn-\/\+C++, application components can be (optionally) compiled and linked into small ($<$2\+MB), single file executables for a specific C\+PU architecture, and then run on all Linux distributions of that architecture.

This comes with a number of deployment, resource efficiency and other advantages. ~\newline

 We provide the documentation here, full working examples and Docker Autobahn-\/\+C++ images with complete pre-\/integrated toolchains\+:

\item {\bfseries \href{https://hub.docker.com/r/crossbario/autobahn-cpp/}{\tt Docker toolchain images}}
\end{DoxyItemize}

This should you get started from working code examples that you can gradually modify to your needs. All example code is M\+IT licensed, so you can safely use it in any software developement context.

If you have questions, you can reach out at\+:

If you found a bug in the documentation or have a correction, improvement or addition you would like see merged, awesome! Please submit an issue or submit a PR directly to the Autobahn-\/\+C++ source repository \href{https://github.com/crossbario/autobahn-cpp}{\tt here}, as all the H\+T\+ML documentation is built from comments in the code using Doxygen. ~\newline
