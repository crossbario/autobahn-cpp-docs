Welcome to the \href{https://github.com/crossbario/autobahn-cpp}{\tt Autobahn-\/\+C++} documentation.~\newline
~\newline
 Autobahn-\/\+C++ is a W\+A\+MP client library that allows to create W\+A\+MP application components in C++. Application components can be built into single executable, statically linked files ($<$2\+MB) that are portable accross Linux distributions on the same C\+PU architecture. ~\newline
~\newline
 We provide the documentation here, full working examples and Docker Autobahn-\/\+C++ images with complete pre-\/integrated toolchains\+:

\item {\bfseries \href{https://hub.docker.com/r/crossbario/autobahn-cpp/}{\tt Docker toolchain images}}
\end{DoxyItemize}

This should you get started from working code examples that you can gradually modify to your needs. All example code is M\+IT licensed, so you can safely use it in any software developement context.
